Memory Forge is a desktop application that converts raw .txt or .mp3 files into structured memory chunks for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) workflows.
We are also trying to now incorporate a new user interface that allows the user to create regex search patterns (third party python module regex, like pip install regex) and have them be
automatically synced with process.py when the user wants to update their regex dictionary.
